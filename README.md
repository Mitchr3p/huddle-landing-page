# Simple Responsive Webpage

This is a simple responsive webpage project created using HTML and CSS. The project is designed to be responsive to various screen sizes.

### Challenge

This project was created as a personal learning exercise to practice HTML and CSS. The main objectives were:

- Build a responsive webpage that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Explore CSS styling and layout techniques.

## My Process

Having Fun While Learning

I worked on this project for about 2 hours, and it was a bit like a mini adventure. I had to use the internet to look up some things and remember how to make stuff look cool, like adding shadows to elements on the webpage.

With cool breeze and good tunes, progress really shines haha.

One funny thing that happened was with a button. When I accidentally put a space in the wrong place, it made the button not work at all lol. It's funny how small things like that can make a big difference in the world of coding.

Overall, I enjoyed working on this project. It's not just about writing code; it's also about having a bit of fun and learning new things along the way. ðŸ˜„
